# ch3movieTicketsPurchase
Write a program that lets a user purchase tickets at the movie theater. There are 3 categories of tickets: regular tickets cost 12 dollars, child tickets cost 6 dollars, and senior tickets cost 9 dollars. Ask the user how many tickets in each category they want to purchase. Calculate the total cost and display the result in fixed-point notation with 2 decimal points, making sure there is a dollar sign, "$", before the result and that the decimal point is always displayed. Run the program once to match the sample below, and take a screenshot. Run it again with different numbers and take a screenshot.  Ch 3 Movie Tickets example     NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.  Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
